# Gluqlo: Fliqlo for Linux

[![Gluqlo](http://alexanderk23.github.io/gluqlo/images/gluqlo.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhT7PBwpMIo)

Gluqlo (or Глюкало, if you prefer) is a SDL remake of well-known awesome [Fliqlo screensaver](http://9031.com/goodies/#fliqlo) which is originally avaliable for Windows and OSX platforms only.
Gluqlo is inspired by (and to some extent is based on) [noflipqlo](https://github.com/bhm/noflipqlo) aka Now Open Flipqlo 2.0 by [Jacek Kuźniarski](https://github.com/bhm).
Currently it's very close to original Fliqlo (as I hope).

## Requirements

- SDL 1.2
- SDL_gfx 1.2
- SDL_ttf 2.0
- XScreensaver (optional)

## Installing from PPA (Ubuntu from Vivid up to Xenial)

    $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:alexanderk23/ppa
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install gluqlo

## Building from source on Fedora

First, clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/alexanderk23/gluqlo.git

Second, change directory to `gluqlo`:

    $ cd gluqlo/

Third, install build-time dependencies:

    $ sudo dnf install SDL2 SDL2-devel libX11-devel @development-tools

Fourth, compile and install as usual:

    $ make && sudo make install

Fifth, optional, make gluqlo available in XScreensaver:

    $ sudo cp /usr/lib/xscreensaver/gluqlo /usr/libexec/xscreensaver/ 

Sixth, optional, add gluqlo to your ~/.xscreensaver config file:

  1) Open the configuration file:

    $ sudo nano ~/.xscreensaver

  2) Add the following at the end of (`programs:` section):

    gluqlo -root /n/


## Building from source (Other distros)

First, install build-time dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian):

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libx11-dev

Then compile and install as usual:

    $ make && sudo make install

## Usage

If you want to use Gluqlo as a screensaver, you may need to remove gnome-screensaver (which nowadays just does nothing)
and install XScreensaver (if you're using Ubuntu, see [this page](http://www.howtogeek.com/114027/how-to-add-screensavers-to-ubuntu-12.04/) for detailed instructions).
Don't forget to add gluqlo to your ~/.xscreensaver config file (at `programs:` section):

    gluqlo -root \n\

Otherwise, you can just run it as is.
